# mortal-followers-patch
A small patch that uses zEdit's Unified Patching Framework to set all potential followers as non-essential and unprotected. Soon to add configurable exclusions and optional health-regeneration updates.

Started with the example patcher here (https://github.com/z-edit/zedit-example-patcher)
